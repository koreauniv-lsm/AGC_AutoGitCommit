# AGC_AutoGitCommit
Do you want to get forest in your GitHome? Take my code and run in background.

## Consideration
* On some types of machines, the only unit of time supported is *seconds*

## Idea
1. Make the commit of your repository happen through git fork.

2. Write linux bash shell code so that the commands of git commit and git push can be repeated at regular intervals.

3. Use the Linux watch function to keep track of the log and make it possible to set the cycle directly.

4. Use it so that you can create various texts and pictures in a year-by-year basis with a git commit later.

5. Also, configure the executable file to be expanded to python and exe so that it can be run independent of the os.
